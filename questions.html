        <p>Here are some "frequently" asked questions about me. Feel free to ask me more!</p>
        <br>
        <b>Favorite Color?</b> Green. <br>
        <b>Favorite Code Editor?</b> VS Code. <br>
        <b>Has anyone ever asked you any of these questions?</b> Uhhh... No comment. <br>
        <b>Favorite Video Game?</b> It depends, because there re so many genres. I would say it is a toss-up between Minecraft and Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. <br>
        <b>First experience with coding?</b> When I was in High School, I took a game development course using a program called <a href="https://www.clickteam.com/multimedia-fusion-2">MMF2</a>. It changed my dang life.<br>
        <b>Most surprising fact about computers?</b> Someone once asked me this, and it caught me so off gaurd that I thought about it for quite a while. I've settled on how Boolean Algebra (which is how computers manipulate binary numbers) was not created for computers, but actually for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole#Symbolic_logic">philosophy</a>. Working with binary is, then, kind of like determining truth given a set of facts.<br>
