                Python

        </h2>
        <p>Python is my strongest language. I began using Python in High School as I was just beginning to experiment with "real" programming languages. To Python I owe an understanding, and love, of programming. Currently, I am focusing on learning how to code "pythonically" - that is, to utilize Python's more interesting features to write beautiful code.</p>
        Examples of things I have done with Python:<br>

            <u>
                C++
            </u>
        </h2>
        <p>C++ is my next strongest language. It was my first real experience with a statically typed language, so learning how useful that can be has cemented it as a stong leader in my mind.</p>
        Examples of things I have done with C++:<br>

            <u>
                VHDL
            </u>
        </h2>
        <p>VHDL is a hardware design language. I have used it to program FPGAs. HDLs, in general, are fascinating because you get to structure a logical circuit.</p><br>
        Examples of things I have done with VHDL:<br>
        <a href="https://github.com/architectdrone/Processor_Project">Microprocessor</a> A MIPS-like microprocessor. I am very proud of this, because this was the hardest possible assignment to do in the class I was taking, Digital Logic Design.
