                Python

        </h2>
        <p>Python is my strongest language. I began using Python in High School as I was just beginning to experiment with "real" programming languages. To Python I owe an understanding, and love, of programming. Currently, I am focusing on learning how to code "pythonically" - that is, to utilize Python's more interesting features to write beautiful code.</p>
        Examples of things I have done with Python:<br>

            <u>
                C++
            </u>
        </h2>
        <p>C++ is my next strongest language. It was my first real experience with a statically typed language, so learning how useful that can be has cemented it as a stong leader in my mind.</p>
        Examples of things I have done with C++:<br>

        <p>I don't have much to say about JS, because I just strted learning about it. Hopefully this will be a little fuller soon!</p><br>

            <u>
                VHDL
            </u>
        </h2>
        <p>If you don't know what VHDL is, I don't blame you. It is a Hardware Description Language, and, according to TIOBE, is <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">less popular than Scratch</a>.</p><br>
