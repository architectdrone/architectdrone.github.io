        <h1>Open Combat Flow Tutorial</h1>
        <p class="information">This tutorial will introduce you to the basics of working with OCF.</p>

        <h2>Plan</h2>
        <p>For this tutorial, I will be making a simple adventure game. The player takes the role of the intrepid Captain Limelight. Captain Limelight must use his lazer blaster to keep away the aliens, who are trying to kill him.</p>
        
        <h2>Setting Up...</h2>
        <p>Before beginning this tutorial, put the OCF directory in a place that Python will know where to look. I put mine in the directory that I was creating this tutorial's file in, just so that if anyone wants to look at what I did, they can run the code without installing the OCF dependencies.</p>
    
        <h2>Creating the game file</h2>
        <p>Create a new python file in the directory that you want your game. You can call yours whatever you'd like, I am going to call mine "limelight.py"</p>

        import character as c
