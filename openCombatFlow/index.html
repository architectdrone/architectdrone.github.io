        <h1>Open Combat Flow</h1>
        A collection of tools for rapid development of role playing games. <br>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>I like to make RPGs. They are a super-fun way to express your creativity, and play with game development ideas. However, a common frustration of mine regarding the creation of RPGs is the system within which the player acts. Specifically, balancing combat with a variety of characters. It's not just a programming problem, it's a game theory problem. The system doesn't ust have to work well, it also has to be fair. So, fed up with re-inventing the wheel everytime I started a new project, I created OCF. As time progresses, I am planning to add even more (optional) features to OCF to make development even faster.</p>
        
        <h2>Why should you use OCF?</h2>
        <b>Easy to use: </b>All that you need to do to use the scheduler is make a new class that extends the base Character class, implement nessesary functions, and add them to the scheduler. <br>
        <b>Powerful: </b>OCF's consistent "block" system adds a great deal of modularity to games.<br>
        <b>Easy to modify: </b>OCF is well-documented, meaning it is easy to add new features.<br>
