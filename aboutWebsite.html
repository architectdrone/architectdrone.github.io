        <h1>About this website</h1>
        This website is made using only basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Why? Well, it isn't anything to do with technical advantages (although my lack of skill could explain so things...). Rather, it is due to sentiment. As a kid, I remember logging onto plain, basic HTML sites, and seeing things people did that blew me away, or made me laugh, or think. I still have a special place in my heart for plainly formtted websites, for this reason.
